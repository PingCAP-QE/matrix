# Serializers
## `yaml` / `toml`
These two serializer simply dump values into corresponding format.
## `stmt`

`stmt` serializer is a line-based serializer,
it generates a file, each line of which is generated by one entity in config's value.

To use `stmt` serializer, the `value` field of this config needs to be a list.
The elements of this list should contain two fields: `template` and `value`.
`template` is a string passed to `fmt.Sprintf`, `value` is the specification to generate value, which will be used to format `template` later.

See [tidb-example](../examples/matrix-tidb-tikv-pd.yaml) for an example.
